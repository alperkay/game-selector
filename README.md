# Game Selector App

This web app fetches top 10 most popular games from [IGDB.com 's api](https://igdb.github.io/api/examples/) and
displays the games on the screen for users to vote for the game that they want to play. 

The users tap on the cover photo of each game to vote. Total votes per game is displayed inside the badge on top-right of each game.

The app is built with html, css and javascript. No library or framework was used. 
For fetching the data, the app makes use of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). 

The app is tested with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Brave.
